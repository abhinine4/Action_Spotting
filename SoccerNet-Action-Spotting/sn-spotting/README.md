# SoccerNet - Action Spotting

Welcome to the SoccerNet Development Kit for the Action Spotting Task and Challenge. This kit is meant as a help to get started working with the soccernet data and the proposed task. More information about the dataset can be found on our [official website](https://www.soccer-net.org/).

SoccerNet Action Spotting is part of the SoccerNet-v2 dataset, which is an extension of SoccerNet-v1 with new and challenging tasks including
action spotting, camera shot segmentation with boundary detection, and a novel replay grounding task.

__[New]__ In 2023, we introduce a novel spotting challenge on ball events including drive and passes. Those events are much more dense and require a higher level of spotting precision. The density of those events, as well as the subtle underlying movement of the ball and players, make this new task even more challenging. For this new challenge, you only have access to 7 annotated games, so you may want to take a look at different training paradigms such as transfer learning, unsupervised learning or semi-supervised learning. Remember that you still have access to the 500 videos from soccernet to help you.

<p align="center"><img src="Images/GraphicalAbstract-SoccerNet-V2-1.png" width="640"></p>

The Action Spotting dataset consists of 500 complete soccer games including:
 - Full untrimmed broadcast videos in both low and high resolution.
 - Pre-computed features such as ResNET-152.
 - Annotations of actions among 17 classes (Labels-v2.json).

 The new Ball Action Spotting dataset consists of 7 complete soccer games including:
 - Full untrimmed broadcast videos in both low and high resolution.
 - Annotations of actions among 2 classes (Labels-ball.json).

Participate in our upcoming Challenges during the [CVPR 2023 International Challenge at the CVSports Workshop](https://vap.aau.dk/cvsports/)! All details are provided on our [evaluation server](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1949/overview) for the Action Spotting task, and on another [evaluation server](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1950/overview) for the ball action spotting task, or on the [main soccernet page](https://www.soccer-net.org/).

The participation deadline is fixed at the 30th of May 2023.
The official rules and guidelines are available on [ChallengeRules.md](ChallengeRules.md).

## How to download the dataset

### SoccerNet-v2 Action Spotting

A [SoccerNet pip package](https://pypi.org/project/SoccerNet/) to easily download the data and the annotations is available. 

To install the pip package simply run:

<code>pip install SoccerNet</code>

Then use the API to downlaod the data of interest:

```
from SoccerNet.Downloader import SoccerNetDownloader
mySoccerNetDownloader = SoccerNetDownloader(LocalDirectory="/path/to/SoccerNet")
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["Labels-v2.json"], split=["train","valid","test"])
```

If you want to download the videos, you will need to fill a NDA to get the password.

```
mySoccerNetDownloader.password = input("Password for videos?:\n")
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_224p.mkv", "2_224p.mkv"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_720p.mkv", "2_720p.mkv", "video.ini"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
```
We provide several features including ResNET (used for our [benchmarks](Benchmarks)), and last year's winners features from [Baidu Research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14447.pdf). Check out our [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/SoccerNet/) documentation for more features.
```
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy", "2_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_baidu_soccer_embeddings.npy", "2_baidu_soccer_embeddings.npy"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
```


### SoccerNet Ball Action Spotting

The easiest way to download and prepare the data is to use the following python code.

```
python Download/download_ball_data.py --dataset_dir path/to/SoccerNet --password_videos "password_received_from_NDA"
```

Alternatively, you may use the same pip package as for SoccerNet-v2.

The following code will download the videos and annotations (except annotations on the challenge set) in separated zip files.

```
from SoccerNet.Downloader import SoccerNetDownloader as SNdl
mySNdl = SNdl(LocalDirectory="path/to/SoccerNet")
mySNdl.password =  input("Password for videos?:\n")
mySNdl.downloadDataTask(task="spotting-ball-2023", split=["train", "valid", "test", "challenge"])
```

Note that you may have to extract and merge the zip files yourself if you choose the second option.

## How to extract video features 

As it was one of the most requested features on SoccerNet-V1, this repository provides functions to automatically extract the ResNet-152 features and compute the PCA on your own broadcast videos. These functions allow you to test pre-trained action spotting, camera segmentation or replay grounding models on your own games.

The functions to extract the video features can be found in the [Features](Features) folder.

## Benchmark Implementations

### SoccerNet-v2 Action Spotting

This repository contains several [benchmarks](Benchmarks) for action spotting, which are presented in the [SoccerNet-V2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13367.pdf), or subsequent papers. You can use these codes to build upon our methods and improve the performances.

### SoccerNet Ball Action Spotting

The benchmark to beat this year is the [E2E-spot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10213) method published at ECCV 2022 by J. Hong et. al trained with default parameters and 25fps videos. This method arrived second in the 2022 Action Spotting Challenge The code will be updated on their [github repository](https://github.com/jhong93/spot) for anyone to reproduce the baseline results and improve on them.

## Evaluation

This repository and the pip package provide evaluation functions for the proposed tasks based on predictions saved in the JSON format. See the [Evaluation](Evaluation) folder of this repository for more details.

## Visualizations

Finally, this repository provides the [Annotation tool](Annotation) used to annotate the actions. This tool can be used to visualize the information. Please follow the instruction in the dedicated folder for more details.
